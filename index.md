[Bio](./bio.html) - [CV](https://github.com/kellinpelrine/kellinpelrine.github.io/raw/master/assets/KPelrine%20CV.pdf) - [Publications](./publications.html) - [Collaboration](./coming-soon.html)

I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), research advisor at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/), and cofounder and CSO at startup Stitch.

I lead research hoping to create practical, transformatively impactful machine learning systems. Recently, I have focused on AI safety, misinformation mitigation, and AI agents. I've also worked on education, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. At FAR AI, collaborators and I have several projects on robustness of frontier models and of superhuman AIs that play the board game Go; for beating the latter as a human I've been called the "man who beat the machine". At Stitch, we're building the AI extension of your imagination with a visual interface for LLMs.
