[Bio](./bio.html).

I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila AI Institute, supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship and a research scientist intern at FAR AI.

My research centers on two topics: developing learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data, and shrinking the performance gap between laboratory and real world. My work on these themes bridges multiple domains and applications, including building healthier social media ecosystems, better evaluation for temporal graphs, fighting human trafficking, and building more reliable machine learning systems.
