I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), research advisor at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/), and cofounder and CSO at startup Stitch.

My research aims to create more practical, positively impactful machine learning systems. Recently, my research has focused on misinformation mitigation, AI safety, and AI agents. I've also worked on education, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. At FAR AI, collaborators and I have several projects on robustness LLMs and of superhuman AIs that play the board game Go; for beating the latter as a human I've been called the "man who beat the machine". At Stitch, we're building the AI extension of your imagination.
