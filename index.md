I'm Cofounder and CTO at startup [Stitch](https://getstitch.ai/). I'm also a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) (supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany and Jean-Fran√ßois Godbout), a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), and a research advisor at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/).

I lead teams hoping to create practical, transformatively impactful machine learning systems. At Stitch, we're building the AI extension of your imagination with a visual interface for LLMs. On the research side, my recent focus has been AI safety, AI agents, and education. I've also worked on political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. At FAR AI, collaborators and I have several projects on robustness of frontier models and of superhuman AIs that play the board game Go; for beating the latter as a human I've been called the "man who beat the machine".
