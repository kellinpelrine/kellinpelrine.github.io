I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), a research scientist intern at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/), and scientific advisor at startup MutuAI.

My research aims to create more practical machine learning systems. I particularly focus on the inputs and outputs, which are underexplored. On the input side, this means learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data. On the output side, this means improving generalization and shrinking the gap between laboratory measurements and real world outcomes. The research I've done on these themes bridges multiple domains and applications, including work towards healthier social media ecosystems, less human trafficking, and more reliable and thoroughly evaluated machine learning systems.
