I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [FAR.AI](https://far.ai/) and a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/).

I lead cross-functional teams building solutions on technical foundations. Our work aims to uncover, understand, and solve AI risks across misuse, misalignment, and loss of control. Some active lines of work span tampering, persuasion, red-teaming, evaluation, and demos. 

When time allows, I'm a foodie, and an avid player and teacher of the board game Go. For beating "superhuman" Go AIs as a human, I've been called the man who beat the machine.
