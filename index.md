[CV](./CV.html).

I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila AI Institute, supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship, and a research scientist intern at FAR AI. Before that I completed a master's in economics at Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder.

My research centers on two topics: developing learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data, and shrinking the performance gap between laboratory and real world. These themes bridge many domains and applications. A lot of my work is on creating healthier social media ecosystems, for instance through better ways to mitigate misinformation or understand political polarization. Another key area is temporal graphs, where I've worked on improving evaluation and am one of the organizers for the Temporal Graph Learning Workshop (last held at NeurIPS 2022). I also work on extracting information to fight human trafficking, and on robustness of agents that play the board game Go.
