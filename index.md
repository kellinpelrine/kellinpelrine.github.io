I'm a PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila AI Institute, supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. I'm also a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship and a research scientist intern at FAR AI.

My research centers on two topics: learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data, and shrinking the performance gap between laboratory and real world. The research I've done on these themes bridges multiple domains and applications, including work towards healthier social media ecosystems, less human trafficking, and more reliable and thoroughly evaluated machine learning systems.
