I'm a research scientist at [FAR.AI](https://far.ai/) and a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/).

I lead cross-functional solutions built on technical foundations. Several teams I lead are working to make AI a transformatively positive force (instead of a potentially catastrophically negative one) on our ability to find reliable information and build knowledge. I also have lead work on exposing, understanding, and solving AI misuse risks. My research has been published in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, EMNLP, KDD, and WebConf, and has been featured multiple times by press like the Financial Times, The Times, Vice, Scientific American, and Nature Magazine. For beating superhuman AIs that play the board game Go I've been called the "man who beat the machine".
