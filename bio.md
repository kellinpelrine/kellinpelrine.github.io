## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) (supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany and Jean-François Godbout), a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), and a research advisor at [FAR.AI](https://far.ai/). Previously he cofounded Stitch, Mutual, and Machine Learning Sports, and before that he completed a master's in economics at Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Pelrine leads teams of over 40 collaborators hoping to create practical, transformatively impactful machine learning systems. To do that, he focuses on not only new methods but more realistic data, more comprehensive experiments, and deeper understanding. His work focuses on making generative AI a reliable, trustworthy tool to navigate the information ecosystem. Pelrine has worked on diverse applications such as AI safety, education, disinformation and manipulation, political polarization, human trafficking, adversarial robustness, and temporal graphs. His research has been published in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, EMNLP, and WebConf, and has been featured multiple times in the news such as the Financial Times, The Times, Vice, Scientific American, and Nature. It has also been cited in the US Senate, and has been supported by multiple awards and fellowships, including a Doctoral Training Scholarship from Fonds de Recherche du Québec, a Doctoral Excellence Scholarship from IVADO, and 8 awards and fellowships from McGill University.

In free time, he is an avid player and teacher of the board game Go. He has twice been a US representative in international events, including the World Mind Sports Games. For beating "superhuman" Go AIs as a human, he has been called the man who beat the machine.
