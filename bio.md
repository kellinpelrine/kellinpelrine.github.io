## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is currently a PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila AI Institute, supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. He's also a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship and a research scientist intern at FAR AI. Previously he completed a master's in economics at Yale University, and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Pelrine's research centers on two themes: developing learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data, and shrinking the performance gap between laboratory and real world. These themes bridge multiple domains and applications. A lot of his work is on creating healthier social media ecosystems, for instance through better ways to mitigate misinformation or understand political polarization. Another key area is temporal graphs, where he has worked on improving evaluation and is one of the organizers for the Temporal Graph Learning Workshop (last held at NeurIPS 2022). He also works on extracting information to fight human trafficking, and on robustness of superhuman systems that play the board game Go. His research has been supported by a 2021 Doctoral Excellence Scholarship from IVADO, as well as 6 awards and fellowships from McGill University.

He is also an avid player and teacher of Go. He holds a 6-dan rank with the American Go Association, and has twice been a US representative in international events, including the World Mind Sports Games.
