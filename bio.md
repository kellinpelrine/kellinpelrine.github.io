## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is a Member of Technical Staff at [FAR.AI](https://far.ai/) and a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) (supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany and Jean-Fran√ßois Godbout). Previously he cofounded Stitch, Mutual, and Machine Learning Sports, and before that he completed a master's in economics at Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Pelrine leads cross-functional teams towards secure, transformatively impactful AI systems. His current work spans exposing, understanding, and solving AI risks across misuse, misalignment, and loss of control; making generative AI a reliable and trustworthy tool to navigate the information ecosystem; and creating interactive demos that translate abstract results into firsthand experience. Previously, he has worked on a wide range of problems in AI safety and security, education, persuasion and manipulation, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. His work has uncovered vulnerabilities and risks of models from every frontier AI company, influencing industry and governments. It has been published in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, KDD, EMNLP, and WebConf, and featured in major media outlets including The Financial Times, The Times, Vice, Scientific American, and Nature.

When time allows, he is a foodie, and an avid player and teacher of the board game Go. He has twice represented the US in international competition, including the World Mind Sports Games. For beating "superhuman" Go AIs as a human, he has been called the man who beat the machine.
