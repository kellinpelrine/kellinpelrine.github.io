## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is currently a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. He's also a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), research advisor at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/), and cofounder and CSO of startup Stitch. Previously he cofounded Mutual and Machine Learning Sports, and before that he completed a master's in economics at Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Pelrine's research aims to address the gap between research and real world to create practical, impactful AI systems. To do that, he focuses on not only new methods but aims for better evaluation, more realistic data and settings, and deeper understanding. He has worked on diverse applications such as AI safety, misinformation, political polarization, human trafficking, education, adversarial robustness, and temporal graphs. His work has been published in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, EMNLP, and WebConf. It has also been supported by multiple awards and fellowships, including a Doctoral Training Scholarship from Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec, a Doctoral Excellence Scholarship from IVADO, and 8 awards and fellowships from McGill University.

While still a PhD student, he currently supervises projects with over 35 collaborators, and has directly mentored over two dozen junior researchers from undergrad to post-PhD levels. He has also cofounded three startups, most recently Stitch, where he leads work building a visual interface for LMMs. In free time, he is also an avid player and teacher of the board game Go. He has twice been a US representative in international events, including the World Mind Sports Games. He has been called the man who beat the machine in Go, as reported in media outlets such as the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1).
