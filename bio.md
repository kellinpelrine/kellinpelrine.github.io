## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is a Member of Technical Staff at [FAR.AI](https://far.ai/) and leads the Integrity team. Previously he cofounded Stitch, Mutual, and Machine Learning Sports, and completed a PhD at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) (supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany and Jean-François Godbout). He also holds a master's in economics from Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Pelrine leads cross-functional teams towards secure, transformatively impactful AI systems. His current work spans uncovering, understanding, and solving AI risks across misuse, misalignment, and loss of control; making generative AI a reliable and trustworthy tool to navigate the information ecosystem; and creating interactive demos that translate abstract results into firsthand experience. His prior work spans a wide range of problems in AI safety and security, education, persuasion and manipulation, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. He has found and helped safeguard vulnerabilities and risks of models from every frontier AI company, influencing industry and governments. His work has been published in top venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, KDD, EMNLP, and WebConf, and featured in major media outlets including The Financial Times, The Times, Vice, Scientific American, and Nature.

When time allows, he is a foodie, and an avid player and teacher of the board game Go. He has twice represented the US in international competition, including the World Mind Sports Games. For beating "superhuman" Go AIs as a human, he has been called the man who beat the machine.
