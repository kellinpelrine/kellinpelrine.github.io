## Bio

Kellin Pelrine is currently a PhD candidate at McGill University and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. He's also a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/), a research scientist intern at [FAR AI](https://far.ai/), and scientific advisor at MutuAI. Previously he was the CTO of Machine Learning Sports, and before that he completed a master's in economics at Yale University and a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. 

Pelrine's research aims to address the gap between research and real world to create more practical AI systems. To do that, his research focuses on two themes: learning paradigms that can better leverage the full breadth of available data, and improving evaluation and other tools to ensure good results in laboratory conditions translate to good results in practice. These themes bridge multiple domains and applications. A lot of his work is on creating healthier social media ecosystems, for instance through better ways to mitigate misinformation or understand political polarization. Another key area is temporal graphs, where he has worked on improving evaluation and is one of the organizers for the Temporal Graph Learning Workshop (last held at NeurIPS 2022). He also works on extracting information to fight human trafficking, and on robustness of superhuman systems that play the board game Go. Recently, he has started working with startup MutuAI to develop sophisticated but reliable non-player computer game characters, and social assistants. His research has been supported by a 2023 Doctoral Training Scholarship from Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec, a 2021 Doctoral Excellence Scholarship from IVADO, as well as 6 awards and fellowships from McGill University.

He is also an avid player and teacher of Go. He holds a 6-dan rank with the American Go Association, and has twice been a US representative in international events, including the World Mind Sports Games. He has been called the man who beat the machine in Go, as reported in numerous media outlets including the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1), [The Times](https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1), and [VICE](https://www.ft.com/content/175e5314-a7f7-4741-a786-273219f433a1).
